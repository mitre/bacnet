## Architecture
This section describes the main components of the plugin and how they interface.

### Block Diagram
![BACnet Plugin Block Diagram](assets/bacnet_blockdiagram.png)

The BACnet Plugin exposes several new protocol specific abilities to your Caldera instance. The abilities are executed from a host running a Caldera agent via the corresponding payload. Abilities must target devices that support the BACnet protocol to achieve the described effects.

### Payloads

The BACnet plugin leverages several payloads that are part of the BACnet Stack detailed in the [libraries](#libraries) section. Each payload is an individual BACnet service, with a name combining `bac` + `service_name`. The payloads have been compiled for 2 different architectures.

Example payloads for BACnet Read Property service:
* `bacrp.exe` - Windows executable **Read Property** protocol service
* `bacrp` - Linux executable for the **Read Property** protocol service


### Libraries
The following libraries were used to build the BACnet payloads:

| Library | Version	 | License |
|---------|--------- |---------|
|bacnet-stack |[1.0](https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/tree/bacnet-stack-1.0) |[GPL](https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/tree/master/license)      |

## Usage
This section describes how to initially deploy and execute the abilities present within the BACnet plugin.

### Deployment
1. Identify the target system(s) and/or device(s) you would like to communicate with via BACnet.
2. Identify a viable host for the Caldera agent that is able to communicate with the target system/device(s) and is compatible with one of the [payload versions](#compatibility).
3. Deploy the Caldera agent to the identified host.*
4. Use the Caldera server to execute `bacnet` plugin abilities as desired.*

* If you don't know where to begin, try using [Who-Is](#who-is) to discover BACnet devices on the network.

*Reference the Caldera training plugin for a step-by-step tutorial on how to deploy an agent and run abilities via an operation.

Here is a small selection of resources to aid in understanding of the BACnet protocol. You may already have more specific specification documents, vendor manuals, and other resources to assist with understanding the state of your target environment.

* ["ASHRAE Technical FAQ 51: What is BACnet?" (ASHRAE)](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/technical-faqs/question-51-what-is-bacnet)

* ["The Language of BACnet-Objects, Properties, and Services" (BACnet Committee)](https://bacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/The-Language-of-BACnet-1.pdf)

A few additional references are also linked to in the [Abilities](#abilities) overview below.

### Abilities

#### Who-Is
    The Who-Is service is used by a sending BACnet-user to determine the Device object identifier, the network address, or both, of other BACnet devices that share the same internetwork.

    Usage:
      ./bacwi

#### Who-Has
    The Who-Has service is used by a sending BACnet-user to determine the Device object identifier, the network address, or both, of BACnet devices that contain a given object name or object identifier.

    Usage:
      ./bacwh <device-instance-min> <device-instance-max> <object-name>*

    Arguments:
      device-instance-min     Minimum device instance to check
      devie-instance-max      Maximum device instance to check
      object-name*            Name of an object to check for

    *both an object-type and object-instance can also be provided instead of an object-name

    Example:
      ./bacwh 100200 100300 "Timer"
      ./bacwh 100200 100300 binary-value 7

    If a device in the instance range has that object, an "I-Have" response will be reported, stating the object-type and object-instance

#### EPICS Report
    Generates an EPICS report - which provides services supported, the object list, and properties of those objects.

    Usage:
      ./bacepics <device-instance>

    Arguments:
      device-instance    Instance number of the device (can also be IP:Port of the device instead)

    Example:
      ./bacepics 100101

#### Get Event Information
    The GetEventInformation service is used by a client BACnet-user to get a summary of all active state events on the target device.

    Usage:
      ./bacge <device-instance>

    Arguments:
      device-instance    The instance number of the device (can also be IP:Port of the device instead)

    Example:
      ./bacge 100101


#### Read Property
    The ReadProperty service is used by a client BACnet-user to request the value of one property of one BACnet Object.

    Usage:
      ./bacrp <device-instance> <object-type> <object-instance> <property> <index>

    Arguments:
      device-instance    Instance number of the device (can also be IP:Port of the device instead)
      object-type        The type of object to be read (bacenum.h > BACNET_OBJECT_TYPE)
                          e.g., object-type (8): Device
      object-instance    The instance number of the object-type specified (this is specific to the device)
      property           The property of the object to be read (bacenum.h > BACNET_PROPERTY_ID)
                          e.g., property (76): Object List
      index
          -2: An improved -1 for arrays. Iteratively reads each index of the array-type property to avoid seg issue
          -1: Reads the whole property (this can fail for arrays if the device doesn't support segmentation)
           0: Gets the length of the property if it is an array type
        1..N: Gets the property value at index N if it is an array type

    Example:
      ./bacrp 100101 8 100101 76 -2

#### Read Property Multiple
    The ReadPropertyMultiple service is used by a client BACnet-user to request the values of one or more specified properties of one ore more BACnet Objects. For example, a single property for a single object, a list of properties for a single object, or even any number of properties for any number of objects.

    Usage:
      ./bacrpm <device-instance> <object-type> <object-instance> <property>

    Arguments:
      device-instance    Instance number of the device (can also be IP:Port of the device instead)

    Example:
      ./bacrpm 100101 8 100101 77,28

    *Read Property Multiple is similar to Read Property, but allows multiple properties to be provided, in the form of a comma separate list (e.g., "1,2,3").

    The BACnet plugin provides 2 additional abilities with bacrpm presets that may be helpful:
    BACnet Device Collection - Basic Example:
      ./bacrpm 100101 device 100101 77,121,70,28,76
